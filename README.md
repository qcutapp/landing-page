# Install

You require `node` and `npm` installed to bundle or develop the website. Install the NPM modules:

```bash
npm install
```

To develop the website run:

```bash
npm run develop
```

This starts a live server at [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234)

To build the website run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The entire website along with all the assets will be created at `dist/` folder. You can simply dump this folder onto your webserver to serve the `dist/index.html` page.
